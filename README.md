# julia-multiple-dispatch

Julia's multiple dispatch system allows you to easily define and extend the behavior of functions based on the types of their input arguments. This can lead to simpler, more flexible, and extensible code. Let's consider a simple example to demonstrate this, using geometric shapes.

Suppose you need to calculate the area of different geometric shapes: rectangles and circles. In Python, you might do this using classes with methods.

The Julia code is more elegant and extensible due to multiple dispatch. You can easily add support for new shapes without modifying the existing code or creating additional methods. For example, to support triangles, you can simply define a new struct and an area function for that struct.

In Python, you would have to create a new class with its own area method, which can lead to more boilerplate code and less flexibility. Julia's multiple dispatch system allows for cleaner and more modular code that can be extended with ease.
